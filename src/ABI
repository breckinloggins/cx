Two of the primary goals of Cx are:
	- Remain compatible with C to the highest extent possible
	- Produce code as small as possible to accomplish the task
	
To meet these goals, the Cx Application Binary Interface (ABI) will be clearly and cleanly specified.  Cx language features will use the bare minimum of C code necessary to do the job.  The C code that is required will be wrapped in macros and functions so that they can be used by C modules to talk to Cx types and namespaces.

Name mangling will be well-defined.   If you have a method of a class inside a namespace, the name of the method callable in C will be:
	namespace_class_methodname[_integer](...);

Where [_integer] is tacked on if there are multiple method overloads.  We'll have to figure out what to do if these get too long, but I'm thinking we have a standard way of shortening the names.

When a Cx application uses the standard library, it only pulls in the minimum needed to do the work.  Using Console.WriteLine() will NOT pull in 8mbs of crap into the binary.
